### Help!

Here you will find the implementation of our Tabs component. The component works like a charm but sadly the code is not so good. We need your help to write modern and well structured code. There is no one perfect solution, the important thing here is to refactor the component until you think it can no longer be improved. We do not expect any change in the behaviour, just improve the code quality and make it a more robust component.

Adding some tests or a storybook would be a plus.

Feel free to take liberties with how you manage the css, typescript, testing, etc...

The goal is to take ownership of the component and show us you prefered component management style.

Thanks for dedicating us your time!
